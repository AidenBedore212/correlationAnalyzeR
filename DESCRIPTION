Description: Correlation AnalyzeR is a powerful tool for understanding how genes
    relate to eachother based on the 	world's largest repository of standardized
    RNA-Seq data, ARCHS4 [https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/index.html]. In 
    'single-analysis' mode, correlation data for genes of interest are used to
    return correlated pathways by GSEA. In 'paired-analysis' mode, a user can
    examine how a primary gene of interest correlates with a defined list of
    other genes. Finally, 'group-analysis' mode examines correlation data for a
    defined gene group to generate a robust gene-level topology.
